# FindMeTheRecipe
Two Data sources, Retrieval in Json format using API, Classes and caching components, Interactive Tree project

 The program suggests recipes based on user input and preferences. Run the FindMeTheRecipe.py file and follow the prompts to provide inputs to the program. To run the program successfully, please include the recipes.json, cuisine.txt, diet.txt and FindMeTheRecipe.py in the same directory on your computer. The project requires the use of the requests package and it must be installed prior to use. The API key used to retrieve data from the spoonacular API is included in the code and should not be changed. As a precautionary measure, only 150 requests can be made on the website everyday. To scale up the project, please contact prekshah@umich.edu.
